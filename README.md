# Antennae
An attempt to fetch current live Twitch streams that I follow, and list them to standard output.

By default:
* The script finds all channels you follow, then checks each of those to determine if 
any of them are currently live. 

By extension:
* The script outputs results to STDOUT, which can be fed into a wrapper script to easily launch
livestreamer with the requested script.

###Usage
Just run the script, and it'll spit out the info.

###Modification
But if you want to see the channels that _you_ follow, modify the "user" variable to your Twitch username
