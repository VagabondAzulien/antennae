# Antennae
An attempt to fetch current live Twitch streams that I follow, and list them to standard output.

By default:
* The script finds all channels you follow, then checks each of those to determine if 
any of them are currently live. 

By extension:
* The script outputs results to STDOUT, which can be fed into a wrapper script to easily launch
[livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer) with the requested script.

###README
####Usage
Just run the script, and it'll spit out the info.

####Modification
But if you want to see the channels that _you_ follow, modify the "user" variable to your Twitch username

####To-Do
* [ ] Complete script
* [ ] Add wrapper for [livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer)
* [ ] Add wrapper for use in [bar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar)
